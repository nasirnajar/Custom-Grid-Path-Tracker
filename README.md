# Custom-Grid-Path-Tracker
 Built an interactive web tool to visualize all possible paths in a grid from (0,0) to (n,m). • User inputs number of rows and columns, along with barrier positions, to calculate total valid paths. • Implemented dynamic visualization of paths considering obstacles for better understanding of grid traversal.
